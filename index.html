	<p> Q2: The styleAll function is setting up styling parameters for the data/ points. For the Amtrak stations, it is styling the points based on zipcodes. For megacities, it is giving a general style for all the points. Thus, these functions are conditional styling. The Styles variable sets up the overal style, in which the style functions can adapt.</p>
	<p> Q4: Feature refers to the type of data being used. Layers refers to which feature-layer is being used in the popups (for example zipcodes, or city names).</p>
	<p> Q5: 'layer.options.fill' is styling the layer's points to either be filled in or not. 'layer.getLatLng' is providing the latitude and longitude of the points.</p>
	<p> Q6: This changed the styling of the points and drastically increased their size (with a new radius of 80 for each point).</p>
